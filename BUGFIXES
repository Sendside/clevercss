List of bug fixes since CleverCSS-0.1
===================================

4/20/09 - v.0.1.3 - submitted by Antti Kaihola - Using the rgb_to_hls() and hls_to_rgb() functions in CleverCSS to convert colors back and forth reveals a mistake in the HLS to RGB algorithm. Fractional parts are stripped when rounding should be done instead.
